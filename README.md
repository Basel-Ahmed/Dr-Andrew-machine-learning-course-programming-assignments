Machine Learning (Coursera)

This is my solution to all the programming assignments of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. After completing this course you will get a broad idea of Machine learning algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.

# Issues 
- For each programming exercise, there is a pdf file that explains how to understand the code and how to go with the functions implemented
- In programming exercises 1,2, and 5, I tried the algorithms on more data than the data course provides, so you have to change the name of the uploaded data in each programming exercise.
